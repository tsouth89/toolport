All notable changes to Conduit are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions match the GitHub releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Client config writes are now atomic (temp file + rename), so a crash or full
  disk mid-write can't truncate a client's MCP config.
- One unresponsive stdio server no longer stalls the whole gateway: the connect
  handshake fails fast (10s) instead of waiting the full 30s read timeout.
- Playground policy toggles report failures instead of silently reverting.
- The share-import file size is capped before reading.
- Updater "Check for updates" tells "up to date" apart from "couldn't check".

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- First-run onboarding wizard: detect clients, add your first servers (import,
  one-click popular starters, or the catalog), and connect a client. Re-run it
  anytime from the sidebar footer.
- In-app auto-updater: Conduit checks for new releases and can download, install,
  and relaunch itself, with release notes shown before installing.
- Share a setup as a `.json` file (in addition to the clipboard), with an optional
  name and description. Secrets are never included.
- Per-tool breakdown in the Activity dashboard, plus server and errors-only filters.

### Changed
- Reliability: gateway recovers from a poisoned lock, the audit log rotates so it
  can't grow unbounded, more tolerant SSE id matching, and a guard against
  overlapping health probes (which curbed macOS keychain prompt storms).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- Signed and notarized macOS builds (Apple Silicon + Intel), alongside Windows
  and Linux, via a tag-triggered release pipeline.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-20

- First public release: local MCP gateway and manager with lazy discovery,
  per-agent profiles, the catalog, the tool playground, and the activity log.
