## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.8] - 2026-06-21

### Improved
- **Faster, more decisive tool search, especially with local models.** Search now
  leads with the single best match and tells the model to call it; the remaining
  results come back as a compact menu (name + a one-line description, no schema)
  instead of every tool's full schema. A large result set drops from tens of KB to a
  few KB, so a model that re-reads its context each turn (local models especially)
  runs noticeably faster. Full schema for any other tool still comes from a scoped or
  exact-name search.
- **A loop-breaker for weaker models.** When a model re-searches and keeps landing on
  the same top tool, the gateway returns just that tool and tells it to call it,
  rather than letting the model spin on repeated searches. It only triggers on a
  repeated top result, so a capable model, or one legitimately exploring different
  tools, is never affected.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Five more clients: Zed, LM Studio, Warp, Amazon Q, and Kiro.** Conduit detects
  each, installs the gateway with one click, and imports its existing servers.
  - Zed keeps MCP servers under `context_servers` in its `settings.json`, which is
    JSONC (comments and trailing commas) holding the user's whole editor config. That
    file is now read leniently so a commented config isn't mistaken for corrupt, and
    is **never replaced with an empty document on a parse failure**, so Conduit cannot
    wipe your settings.
  - LM Studio, Warp, Amazon Q, and Kiro use the standard `mcpServers` JSON shape at
    their respective config paths (`~/.lmstudio/mcp.json`, `~/.warp/.mcp.json`,
    `~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json`, `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`).

### Fixed
- Client detection now reflects whether an app is actually installed, not merely
  whether an MCP config file happens to exist. The old "config file's parent dir"
  heuristic was wrong for some clients: Claude Code's config lives at `~/.claude.json`
  (parent is the home dir, which always exists, so it falsely showed as installed
  everywhere), and Warp's `~/.warp` only appears after its first file-based MCP use.
  Those clients now check an explicit install/data directory.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Lazy-discovery tool search is far more reliable on multi-server setups. A tool
  that exists could read as missing (so an agent would wrongly conclude a server
  was "read only"): the default result limit was too low with no signal that
  results were truncated, and one server with many matching tools could crowd out
  the rest. Search now returns more results, reports when it truncated and how to
  narrow, diversifies across servers, and accepts a `server` filter to scope or
  fully enumerate one server's tools. `conduit_status` now lists each server and
  its tool count.
- Tool search no longer blows up the agent's context: a few servers ship enormous
  input schemas (tens of KB each), and search returned the full schema for every
  result. It now bounds the total schema size (keeping the top result's full schema
  and returning the rest compact) and truncates long descriptions. Full schema/text
  for a specific tool is available by searching its exact name.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-21

### Security
- Importing a shared setup now previews exactly what it will run (each server's
  command, args, and url) and imports only on confirmation, and flags entries that
  spawn a shell. A shared config can no longer slip an unseen command past you.
- OAuth endpoints discovered from a server's metadata are rejected if they point at
  a private or loopback address while the server itself is public (SSRF guard);
  legitimate local servers are unaffected.
- Set an explicit Content-Security-Policy for the app window.

### Fixed
- Registry writes are atomic, so a crash mid-write can't corrupt your server set.
- A corrupt registry no longer silently makes every tool vanish: the gateway keeps
  serving the last good tool list and logs the problem.
- The user catalog and config backups are stored in one consistent location across
  packaged and unpackaged installs.

### Changed
- Onboarding's final step reflects what you actually set up and explains lazy
  discovery; the empty state offers a "Browse catalog" action; the New Profile
  dialog explains that profiles scope servers, not credentials.
- Clearer macOS OAuth guidance (shown before sign-in, not only after a failure).

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Client config writes are now atomic (temp file + rename), so a crash or full
  disk mid-write can't truncate a client's MCP config.
- One unresponsive stdio server no longer stalls the whole gateway: the connect
  handshake fails fast (10s) instead of waiting the full 30s read timeout.
- Playground policy toggles report failures instead of silently reverting.
- The share-import file size is capped before reading.
- Updater "Check for updates" tells "up to date" apart from "couldn't check".
- macOS builds now publish auto-update artifacts; macOS auto-update was inert in
  v0.3.3 (the update manifest had empty macOS entries).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- First-run onboarding wizard: detect clients, add your first servers (import,
  one-click popular starters, or the catalog), and connect a client. Re-run it
  anytime from the sidebar footer.
- In-app auto-updater: Conduit checks for new releases and can download, install,
  and relaunch itself, with release notes shown before installing.
- Share a setup as a `.json` file (in addition to the clipboard), with an optional
  name and description. Secrets are never included.
- Per-tool breakdown in the Activity dashboard, plus server and errors-only filters.

### Changed
- Reliability: gateway recovers from a poisoned lock, the audit log rotates so it
  can't grow unbounded, more tolerant SSE id matching, and a guard against
  overlapping health probes (which curbed macOS keychain prompt storms).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- Signed and notarized macOS builds (Apple Silicon + Intel), alongside Windows
  and Linux, via a tag-triggered release pipeline.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-20

- First public release: local MCP gateway and manager with lazy discovery,
  per-agent profiles, the catalog, the tool playground, and the activity log.
